GUI:

Lite Version:

- disable "Start Animation" button unless "Confirm Remote PSP Choices" is pressed when changed choices
- get live line by line text output from external commands

Advanced version:

- split view in status and config view
  - begin with domains , choose number of remote PSPs, automatically choose remote psps beginning with psp101 (make it configable)
- change status string globally:
               - available -> local
               - occupied  -> remote
               think about include this in current view
